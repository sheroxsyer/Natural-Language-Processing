Introduction:
The provided code implements several models for generating poetry based on different probabilistic approaches. 
It includes implementations of Bigram, Trigram, Backward Bigram, and Bidirectional models for generating poetry.

Reading Corpus:
1. The code starts by importing necessary libraries like `csv` and `google.colab` for file handling and mounting Google Drive.
2. It mounts the Google Drive where the poetry corpus file is located.
3. Then, it reads the content of the corpus file (`faiz.txt`) and stores it in the `poetry` list.

Preprocessing:
1. Extracting Starting Words: 
The code extracts the starting words from the poetry corpus and stores them in the `starting_words` list. It avoids adding special characters and English letters 
as starting words.
2. Tokenizing Corpus: The corpus is tokenized into individual words and stored in the `w_list` list, excluding special characters.

Model Implementations:
 Bigram Model:
1. Probability Calculation: It defines a function `prob(w_list, s)` to calculate the probability of the next word based on the given starting word `s`. 
It calculates the conditional probability of each possible next word given the starting word and returns the most probable word.
2. Poetry Generation: 
Using the Bigram model, poetry is generated by selecting a random starting word and iteratively selecting the next word based on the probability calculated by the
 `prob` function.

Trigram Model:
1. Probability Calculation: It defines a function `tri_prob(w_list,r, r1)` to calculate the probability of the next word based on the two preceding words `r` and `r1`.
 It calculates the conditional probability of each possible next word given the preceding two words and returns the most probable word.
2. Poetry Generation: Using the Trigram model, poetry is generated in a similar manner to the Bigram model but considering the two preceding words for each word
 selection.

Backward Bigram Model:
1. Probability Calculation: It defines a function `back_prob(w_list, s)` to calculate the probability of the previous word based on the given word `s`.
 It calculates the conditional probability of each possible previous word given the current word and returns the most probable word.
2. Poetry Generation: Using the Backward Bigram model, poetry is generated by selecting a random word and iteratively selecting the previous word based on the
 probability calculated by the `back_prob` function.

 Bidirectional Model:
1. Poetry Generation: It combines the Bigram and Backward Bigram models to generate poetry bidirectionally. It selects a random word and iteratively selects the
 next and previous words based on the probabilities calculated by the Bigram and Backward Bigram models, respectively.

 
The provided code demonstrates the implementation of different probabilistic models for generating poetry based on given corpus. 
Each model has its approach to predict the next or previous word in the poetry sequence, resulting in diverse poetic outputs.
